# To-Do List Project

## Project Overview
This is a simple web-based to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks, adding interactivity using the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handlers.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete, changing their appearance.
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML structure for the to-do list.
- **styles.css**: CSS file that styles the to-do list application.
- **index.js**: JavaScript file containing the functionality for adding, completing, and removing tasks.

## How to Use
1. **Add a Task**: Type a task in the input box and click the "Add" button or press Enter.
2. **Mark Task as Complete**: Click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will be styled differently.
3. **Remove a Task**: Click the red "Remove" button next to a task to delete it.

## Code Highlights
- Uses `addEventListener` to handle events such as clicks and keypresses.
- Manipulates the DOM with methods like `appendChild()`, `removeChild()`, and class modifications.
- JavaScript functions are modular, following best practices for code organization.
